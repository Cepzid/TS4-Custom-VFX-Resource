# TS4-Custom-VFX-Resource
Sims 4 community resource for custom VFX to avoid conflicts.

## About
This is a custom VFX community resource to avoid conflicts as custom VFX has to be added to a single list, mostly similar to the situation with venues. I started this resource because I was already going to be doing it for my mods (converting everything from TS3/TSM), then I realized others could use it and we could avoid conflicts and confusion by maintaining a single resource. Note that it works similarly to XML Injector, mod users grab the latest version from the ModTheSims (MTS) download page that I will be hosting, while unlike XML Injector modders can submit their VFX here, or request VFX to be converted or adjusted and then added to the main download.

NSFW related VFX TBD.

## Download
This works like XML Injector, users _must_ download from the main download page. **Do not include the resource in your downloads!!** It will cause confusion and result in outdated files floating around if you do that.

## Submitting
You can either submit your VFX following the instructions below, or if needing a converted TS3/TSM VFX contact me to request it be added, which is highly preferred, especially for mesh related VFX as they can be tricky and because converted TS3/TSM VFX needs to be the same as the originals.

### Requesting Converted TS3/TSM VFX


## Updates
Since I will be hosting the download on MTS I will also handle patch related updates, which if EA doesn't change anything should be simply opening the VFX and re-saving after the VFX tool updates.

If you are making changes to your custom files after submission for whatever reason, please make sure to list the reason in the push. Also, please avoid altering people's custom VFX or the converted VFX without first contacting the creators (converted contact to me). While this is a community resource, it is still their work and alterations without notice could cause problems for the original reasons they were made. Any alterations to someone's work or converted TS3/TSM VFX without prior notice and approval will not be accepted.

## How to Use the VFX
Works like EA VFX when referencing, find the name of the VFX you want in the CurrentVFXList.txt, then copy and paste it's name in the appropriate spot.

If you need to preview the VFX, install the main download like a normal mod and then download Andrew's VFX player. 

## Contact/Help
If you need help with making VFX, using VFX, or making a mod/CC item in general, please go to the creator server Creator Musings where I or other creators may be able to help:
https://discord.gg/qxz5Kn5
It's a server I made for CC creators and modders of all types to receive help, find tutorials/resources, and hang out with each other. You also do not need to be a creator to join, as everyone is welcome.

If you need to contact me to request a VFX or report an issue, you can do so on any of my social media listed. Discord is the fastest way to reach me though as I am always active there, and if you are in Creator Musings (which hopefully you are!) you can just ping me in the server.
